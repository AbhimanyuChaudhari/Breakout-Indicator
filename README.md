# Breakout Signal Backtesting Project

## Overview
The Breakout Signal Backtesting Project implements and backtests a breakout trading strategy. The strategy aims to identify potential breakout points in price charts and execute trades based on breakout signals. The backtesting is conducted using historical market data to evaluate the effectiveness of the breakout strategy.

## Key Features
- Breakout signal generation based on pivot points.
- Channel analysis for breakout confirmation.
- Backtesting framework to assess strategy performance.
- Buy/sell trade execution with take-profit and stop-loss levels.
